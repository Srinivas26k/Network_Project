## Installation

1. Clone the repository:



   First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinivas26k/Ropar_Network_Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Ropar_Network_Project
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   To keep dependencies isolated, it's recommended to create a virtual environment. Run the following command to create and activate the environment:

   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the Required Dependencies**

   Install the necessary dependencies for the project by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit networkx pandas plotly pyvis faiss-cpu numpy fpdf python-docx
   ```

6. **Run the Application**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using:
   Latest Version
    ```bash
   streamlit run mod.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   streamlit run mod1.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
